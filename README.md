# Machine Learning Projects Collection

## Overview
This repository is a collection of machine learning projects completed through [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) and other platforms or personal initiatives. It showcases a variety of ML techniques, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, applied to diverse problem domains like [e.g., "classification, regression, and clustering"]. The projects demonstrate proficiency in Python and libraries such as `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib`, with goals ranging from predictive modeling to exploratory data analysis.
